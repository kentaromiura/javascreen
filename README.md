javascreen
==========

javascript snippet pretty render to png (or pdf)

Did you ever need to make a presentation using powerpoint, keynote or google docs?

I feel the need to put some short javascript example, but I feel like that opening a browser or any ide,
loading the snippet in it, print screen and cut only the part which interested me, was somewhat boring.

So, here javascreen!

javascreen is based on some opensource tools:
